          Maritime law covers a wide range of activities, including the carriage of goods and passengers by sea, marine insurance, ship registration, and maritime safety. 
          It ensures the smooth operation of maritime activities, protects the rights and interests of parties involved, and regulates conduct on the high seas and inland waterways.
          
          **Key Distinctions:**
          * **Maritime Law vs. Law of the Seas:** The law of the seas is a set of international rules applying to nations on territorial seas. Maritime law is a **private law** that applies to individuals and institutions.
          * **Admiralty Law:** Maritime law is also known as admiralty law, governing nautical issues arising on navigable waters.

          **Key Objectives:**
          1.  Regulation of Shipping Activities: Ensuring safe and efficient shipping operations.
          2.  Protection of Maritime Interests: Safeguarding the rights and interests of shipowners, cargo owners, and other stakeholders.
          3.  Maritime Safety: Promoting the safety of ships, crews, and passengers.
          4.  Environmental Protection: Preventing and mitigating marine pollution.
